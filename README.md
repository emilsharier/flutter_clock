This clock is built as a submission to the contest 'Flutter clock' hosted by Google and Lenovo.
The clock changes the background with a smooth animation when the time changes.
The clock changes times when the hour hand reaches any one of the following times -

    1. 6 pm to 5 am (Night time)
    2. 4 pm to 6 pm (Sunset)
    3. 11 pm to 3 pm (Noon)
    4. 6 am to 10 am (Sunrise)
